Welcome to learning Python3 !!

The set of tutorials provided here are an interactive way of teaching Python.
This labwork contains a set of Python scripts that enable automated way of checking
the output that gets printed on the console/terminal against the expected.

It is recommended to start with the '00_test_using_doctest/introduction' tutorial.

Kindly go through the READ contents within the tutorials.  Rest all tutorials are also
based on the similar approach of exploring various features of Python Language Programming.

One may refer the slide-deck directory for further readings.

Also, the categorization of the tutorials is done in a way to demonstrate the different
kinds of TEST FRAMEWORKS available in and for PYTHON.

Hoping that you guys have a fun learning Python-3 - the interactive way.

Cheers,
Phaneendra
