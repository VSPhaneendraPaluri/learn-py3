# Welcome to Python3.0

Python is an incredible scripting-cum-programming language that has made great advent into many facets of the computing world.  It's also best known for it's integrations with many-a-programming languages.

This project site is dedicated to my Python(3) works and hereby, I'd make an effort to share all my experiences, knowledge that I've gained while working hands-on with Python.

I've also made few efforts to create few lab-sessions for starters.  Readers may find more details may directly start with [lab-sessions]({{ site.baseurl }}/labs).
