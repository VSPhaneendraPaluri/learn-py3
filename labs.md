The set of tutorials provided here are an interactive way of teaching and thereby, self-learning Python. This labwork contains a set of Python scripts that enable automated way of checking the output that gets printed on the console/terminal against the expected.

It is recommended to start with the '00_test_using_doctest/introduction' tutorial.

Kindly go through the READ contents within the tutorials.  Rest all tutorials are also
based on the similar approach of exploring various features of Python Language Programming.

To start with, one may refer to the Python introductory slide-deck here in [PPT]({{ site.repository-path }}/{{site.baseurl}}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/slide-deck/Learning-Python.pptx) format.  Some further information about Python and it's eco-system is provided [here]({{ site.repository-path }}/{{site.baseurl}}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/slide-deck/GettingFamiliar.txt).

Also, the categorization of the tutorials is done in a way to demonstrate the few of the various of TEST FRAMEWORKS available in and for PYTHON.

Hoping that you guys have fun learning Python-3 - the interactive way.
