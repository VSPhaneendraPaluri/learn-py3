## Python UnitTest Frameworks

Python itself provides a unit-testing framework called 'unittest'.  This post would let introduce the users to this testing framework.  Users can try out my new labs on related to 'unittest' framework.  I've also tried to provide solutions alongside my labs.  All these part of already downloaded repository to your list.  You may locate them labs [here]({{ site.repository-path }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tree/{{ site.branch }}/pvs-labs/01_test_using_unittest).  You may locate the solutions [here]({{ site.repository-path }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tree/{{ site.branch }}/pvs-solutions/01_test_using_unittest).

User would find that 'unittest' framework provides assertions that are a major component of this testing framework.  There are various kinds of assertions that unittest framework supports.  Only  few of these have been demonstrated over here.  

As user keeps using and knowing more unittest framework, he/she would soon realize that a downside of this tasting framwork is memorizing the assertion types.  Since, there exists many assertions, users should already be aware of all of these for an effective use of this framework for his tests.  

Nevertheless, it is still a very popular and widely used testing framwork by Python coders, though a new wave has already started to sweep-in, that we'll discuss about in my next post.

Enjoy Unittest'ing until then ... :)
