## PyTest - Python Testing Framework

Hi readers, this is an all new post but for already the existing content.

As one might have seen the other in-built Python testing framework (unittest), unittest framework has it's own pitfalls.  So, as part of this post, we shall now explore the much newer testing framwork, called the 'PyTest'.

PyTest is a much more advanced tseting framework and has a more user friendly calling notations to deal with the various types of assertions.  For instance, unlike in unittest, the user need not remember the different kinds of assertions.  Also with the newly introduced decorators a.k.a. markers, it becomes very easy to mark a test for conditional execution based on the points of considerations.  PyTest brings in many other advancements too.

Here is a link to the lab sessions on [here]({{ site.repository-path }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tree/{{ site.branch }}/pvs-labs/02_test_using_pytest).  The solutions are available under the solutions page.
