# Interactive Python3 Lab-Sessions

Here is my first attempt at creating labs for learning Python.  These are documentation-based tests.  Follow the instructions as mentioned within the instruction guide or the introductory slides for Python.

To get started learning Python3, users may first try to clone the following git repository.
~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/VSPhaneendraPaluri/learn-py3.git
~~~

There-after, users may start from [documentation-tests based labs]({{ site.repository-path }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/tree/{{ site.branch }}/pvs-labs/00_test_using_doctest).

Kindly leave me with your suggestions that you may have.

Happy Python-ing !! :)
